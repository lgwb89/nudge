<div class="data-banner"><h1>Welcome to the new Nudge beta</h1><div class="data-text"><p>Hey! My name's Lou and I make Nudge &mdash; I hope it makes your life a little bit better. You can change what Nudge does, on which sites, below.</p><p>Important: Nudge tracks anonymised data, which I need to make it work better. I can't see any specific URLs or content that you look at, any of your activity other than on Nudge sites, or anything that identifies you to me. But I can see time spent on Nudge sites, and usage of Nudge features.</p><div class="boolean" id="share_data2"><div></div><button class="toggle"><div class="left on">That's OK with me</div><div class="right">I'd prefer not to share anonymised data</div></button></div><p>Two more things. First, the only way I can keep working on Nudge is if loads more people use it. So if you like Nudge, please share it (<a href="http://nudgeware.io" target="_blank">nudgeware.io</a>). Second, I'd love your feedback to make Nudge better, so email me on <a href="mailto:lou@nudgeware.io?Subject=Nudge%20feedback" target="_blank">lou@nudgeware.io</a> with any thoughts.</p><p>Cheers, Lou</p></div></div>
